## Netflix Clone

### About
The base of this clone comes from a [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1TCw9wO1neA) I followed which uses React.js, Redux, Firebase, and Stripe payment integration. I added more funcitonality such as trailers on homepage, sign up page, navbar and footer, and a choose account page (among 5 options). I also added the smooth animations.<br>
I'll soon talk about this clone more on my website [here](http://brysonoar.com/).

### Built With
* React.js
* Redux Toolkit (for global state)
* Firebase (for backend authentication, storage, and hosting)
* Stripe Integration (for payment processing)
